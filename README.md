Moved all the work to the server side, now the api keys are secret :D

I used nodejs for the backend, pretty cool :D


## Important 

To run you have to install [node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

## Used Dependencies 

  - express: for the server app.
  - nodemon: for easy logs.
  - dotenv: for storing the secret keys as env vars.
  - node-fetch: for calling the api.

## ToDo

  - [ ] Make the page beautiful :D
